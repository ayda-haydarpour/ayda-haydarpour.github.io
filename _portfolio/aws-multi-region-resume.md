This project delivers a **static resume site** with **secure access control**, **multi-region failover**, and **automated deployments** from GitHub.

---

## Goals
- Host a static site securely without making S3 buckets public.
- Deliver globally with low latency using CloudFront.
- Set up failover between two AWS regions.
- Automate deployments from GitHub.

## How itâ€™s built

**S3 Buckets**  
- Two **private** buckets:
  - `ayda-resume-us-east-1` (primary)
  - `ayda-resume-eu-west-1` (secondary)
- Store `index.html`, `style.css`, and a PDF resume.

**CloudFront**  
- **Origin Access Control (OAC)** keeps S3 private.
- **Origin group** with failover (primary us-east-1, secondary eu-west-1).
- Forces **HTTPS**; default root object = `index.html`.

**Security**  
- Bucket policies allow only CloudFront (via OAC).
- No public S3 access.

**CI/CD**  
- GitHub Actions:
  1. Syncs files to both S3 buckets.
  2. Invalidates CloudFront so updates go live immediately.
